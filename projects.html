                            <p> For my honors thesis project I worked closesly with one professor and four other students to recreate the popular board game Codenames.
                              Codenames is a board-game where two teams compete by each having a Spymaster give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. 
                              The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team. 
                              For our project we decided to test 3 (Word2Vec, Glove and Probabilistic Fast Text) different algorithms and how effective they were in providing accurate clues 
                              for a set of words, just like in Codenames. We composed a web application that allowed us to send out our project for testing.
                               Below is a link to our thesis paper which explains our process and results. My role in this 
                              project was to help implement and deploy the frontend portion using html/css using HTML and CSS. I also helped help collect our data 
                              to formulate our results.

                                  After our web application was all built, we sent to our fellow peers for testing. The 3 word embeddings/alorigthms 
                                  all had there strengths and weaknesses. In terms of technical asspects of the project we were able to sussecfully
                                  replicate the core mechanics of Codenames.

                                <p> One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a social deduction game in which each player is assigned a specific role and will either 
                                  be on the werewolf team or the villager team. If you're on the villager team the object of the game is to vote off a werewolf. If 
                                you're on the werewolf team the objective is to convince the villagers that you are not a werewolf and to vote off a villager.
                                During my time at CUNY Tech Prep, I worked with a group of 2 other students on a web application based on One Night 
                                Ultimate Werewolf. While creating the game we noticed that we needed 5 key features. The web application would have the players 
                                sign in, randomly assign roles, have the players complete roles, create a chat room for players to discuss, and finally let the 
                                players vote. My role in the project was implementing the fronend side of the project. To do this I used React, HTML/CSS and Socket.io.

                                Within the two months we worked on this project, my team and I were able to implement all the key features we intended to. I learned
                                a lot about React and how to make dynamic web applications. We then demoed our project to approximately 40-50 people and recieved 
                                postive feedback.

                          <p>In the fall of 2019 I took Software Engineering, a class in which I partook in a group project. The project requirements were to 
                            design, create and implement a web application of our choosing. We decided to create an e-commerce site that allows users to rent or buy 
                            sports apparel from other users. My role in this assignment was designing and developing the frontend proponent of the project.
                            To do this I created a UI mockup using Adobe XD. I implemented it using Angular 8 with typescript, HTML and CSS. Below is the github 
                          for the frontend portion of this assignment.</p>

                            <p>In Spring 2019 a group of classmates and I applied and got accepted into the CUNY Startup Accelerator with our project MARTH. We were one of 
                              about 10 groups that were accepted into the program. The 8 week long program was an introductory to world of startups. We were mentored by industry
                              professionals and worked along side them to create not only a working demo, but also a business plan for our startup. MARTH is an augmented reality
                              teaching aid that put mathmatical concepts into visual representations for learning purposes.

                              <p class="title is-4">Results</p>
                              <p> The 8 weeks spent with CUNY Startup Accelerator were a great learning experience. I was able to enhance my knowledge of Unity. 
                                I was also able to improve my UI/UX design skills. Using Adobe XD I created mockups that showed how MARTH could be developed. 
                                While making them I had to keep in mind that we were designing our demo for children. This meant the UX should be navigated towards 
                                them with easy to see designs and visuals. In addition to technical skills, I also learned more about what it takes to run a business and make 
                                a startup. At the end of our 8 weeks, we presented a short demo of our project. Although we did not place in the competition, we learned a lot and 
                                MARTH is something we will always be proud of.

                              <p>At the ICIMS 2018 Halloween Hackathon my group and I created TeamUp. TeamUp is a fitbit app that allows you to compete
                                 with your friends to see who is the fittest. Users join a team and compete in various fitness activities. Our goal was to promote
                                healthy habits through fun and group motivation. My role in the group was the UI/UX design of the app using CSS, HTML and FitBit Studio. </p>

                                <p>Given this was a one day hackathon, we were not able to make something super fancy. None of us had any prior experience making a fitbit app. 
                                  However, we were proud of what we were able to accomplish. We were even able to go home with some prizes! </p>

                          <p>In May of 2018, my team and I developed Buzz at the Spring CUNY Hackathon. Buzz is a AR game made for mobile devices using Unity. The objective
                            of the game is to use real world flowers to collect pollen for your bee hive. The users simply turns AR mode on, points their phones at a flower,
                            and collect the pollen that pops up on the screen. The inspiration behind this was emphasis the importance of bees in our communities, as well as promote
                            fitness and outdoor play.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the competition my team and I were able to successfully create a working demo of our game. While making our demo, I was able to
                              learn how to create UI with Unity and how to connect it with backend using C#. Our hard work paid off as we won the Google MVP Community award.
